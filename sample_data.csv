Task,42,Create Initial Work Plan for Infrastructure as Code,New,Bruce Goldfeder,High,This is the task for creating the initial plan for setting up my Data Science environment where I can begin experimentation for my dissertation using Transformer based Neural Nets.
Task,43,Exercise Dissertation Neural Net Infrastructure with a RAD based language leveraging a pre-trained BERT Neural Net capability,New,Bruce Goldfeder,Normal,""
Task,44,Create and provide all of the specifications for a repeatable and automated capability to recreate inital RAD based language BERT Neural Net capability,New,Bruce Goldfeder,Normal,""
Epic,45,Learn in Depth Transformer Neural Net Architecture,New,Bruce Goldfeder,Normal,This task is to master the Transformer based neural net architecture. Initial investigation will be to leverage BERT as a foundation to extend into novel and unique model designed for Cyber Bullying detection.
Epic,46,Learn in Depth PyTorch high level language supporting neural net model development,New,Bruce Goldfeder,Normal,"The PyTorch python library for the generation of neural nets will serve as my initial higher level library for the creation of transformer based neural net models. Alternatives to this library are Tensor Flow 2.x and/or Keras which are developed and used by Google, the creators of the BERT transformer model upon which my experiments are planned to work upon as foundation."
Epic,47,Create experimental set of data for Cyber Bullying detection,New,Bruce Goldfeder,Normal,The data set for my experiments within my dissertation will be chosen from prior work done in the field. I will put together a matrix for deciding which data set or sets to use and apply heuristics and quantifiable attributes for deciding the best data set to use.
Milestone,48,"Complete Infrastructure Setup, Experimental Design, and Foundational Understanding of Transformer Neural Net Development",New,Bruce Goldfeder,Normal,"The **Infrastructure Milestone** represents the capstone of this semesters research. The primary goals of the Fall 2020 semester will be realized at the completion of this milestone. These are the creation of fully scripted and automated experiment infrastructure in a Cloud environment, the design for research experiments for assessing performance and accuracy of Cyberbullying Detection models, and a full foundational knowledge with supporting code examples for Transformer based Neural Nets using the PyTorch library for development. I**nfrastructure as Code** encompasses setting up repeatable infrastructure in virtual environments (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure, Lambda GPU). This will provide a repeatable set of common infrastructure that can be leveraged for repeated experiements to provide comparable runs with neural nets of varying architectures and configurations. **Experimental Design** represents the creation of a set of experiments to prove the hypothesis of increased performance and accuracy for the detection of Cyberbullying using Transformer based neural net language models. Part of this epic will be the selection of the Cyberbullying data set or sets and prior state of the art examples for comparison. **Foundational Understanding of Transformer Neural Net Development** requires mastering the concepts and liner algebra mathematics underpinning the Transformer architecture as realized in the Google BERT architecture. Full understanding of the supporting library, PyTorch for realizing this model in code is also a prerequisite for beginning the experimentation planned for Spring 2021 semester."
